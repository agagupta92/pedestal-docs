== How to test your servlet-based service

Use the link:../api/pedestal.service/io.pedestal.test.html#var-response-for[`response-for`]
test helper to facilitate testing servlet-based services. It is
recommended to create a `url-for` test helper in order to construct
test requests, particularly when query or path parameters are
involved.

== How to Handle Errors

Add an `:error` implementation to your interceptor(s) or create a purpose-built, error handling interceptor.
If you can't handle the exception in your error handler, throw it so that other interceptors have an opportunity to
handle it.
