== Welcome Back

This is the fourth part in the link:index#_getting_started[Getting
Started] trail. By now, you've built a simple service that vends out
link:hello-world[friendly greetings] by
link:hello-world-query-parameters[name] and can handle a few
link:hello-world-content-types[content types].

We're going to leave our greeting service alone for the time being and
turn our attention to a REST API for some entities. To keep things
simple, we're going to keep the entities in memory. Even so, we will
use the same kind of techniques you would use in a real application.

== What You Will Learn

After reading this guide, you will be able to:

- Use path parameters to identify items
- Generate URLs for new items
- Encode and decode entity bodies

== Guide Assumptions

Like the other guides in the link:index#_getting_started[Getting
Started], this guide is for beginners who are new to Pedestal and may
be new to Clojure. It doesn't assume any prior experience with a
Clojure-based web framework. You should be familiar with the basics of
HTTP: URLs, response codes, and content types.

You do not need experience with any particular database or persistence
framework.

If you like to jump straight in to the deep end, you might be
interested in the link:crash-course[Pedestal Crash Course] which
assumes you know quite a bit about Clojure and web frameworks.

This guide also assumes that you are in a Unix-like development
environment, with Java installed. We've tested it on Mac OS X and
Linux (any flavor) with great results. We haven't yet tried it on the
Windows Subsystem for Linux, but would love to hear from you if you've
succeeded with it there.

== Getting Help if You're Stuck

We'll take this in small steps. If you get stuck at any point in this
guide, please submit an https://github.com/pedestal/docs/issues[issue]
about this guide or hop over to the
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pedestal-users[mailing list]
and raise your hand there.

== Where We Are Going

We will start a new project this time. The service will be a simple "to-do"
list that we keep in memory. Even though we are keeping the data in
memory, we will use the same techniques that we would use to interact
with a real database.

We're going to make a REST style API. Our API will have the following
routes:

|===
| Route | Verb | Action | Response

| /todo | POST | Create a new list | 201 with URL of new list
| /todo | GET  | Return query form | 200 with static page
| /todo/:list-id | GET | View an list | 200 with all items
| /todo/:list-id/:item-id | GET | View an item | 200 with item
| /todo/:list-id/:item-id | PUT | Update an item | 200 with updated item
|===

== Setting Up

We will start this project with another empty directory. (Still
avoiding the template projects for now.)

I'm going to call my project 'todo-api'. Feel free to call yours
something different, but it's up to you to do the mental translation
from here on out.

----
$ mkdir todo-api
$ cd todo-api
$ mkdir src
----

This time, we'll set up our `deps.edn` file first. It will be almost
exactly the same as our last one:

[source,clojure]
.deps.edn
----
include::todo-api/deps.edn[]
----

Our new source file will start off with the usual namespace
declaration:

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::todo-api/src/main.clj[tags=ns]
----

There are a few things we're going to do differently this time
around.

=== Partial Functions

First, you'll notice something different with the `ok`
function. `partial` is a Clojure function that takes a function and
returns a new function that needs fewer arguments. (If you know
functional programming, it curries a function.) In this case, we're
saying that `ok` is exactly like `response` with the first argument
pinned to the value 200. Where `response` wanted two arguments, `ok`
only needs the remaining argument for the body. I like this technique
to make a family of functions that vary in one parameter. We'll use
this later to make other functions for different HTTP status codes.

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::todo-api/src/main.clj[tags=response_partials]
----

Obviously we could just pass in the HTTP status codes from wherever we
generate the responses. I think the named functions communicate my
intentions better though. As we enhance these, they will form a little
language for HTTP responses. No framework needed (yet).

=== Routes Up Front

Second, we're going to define all our routes right away, but have them
all use an `echo` handler so we can test the routes separately from
everything else. (See
link:hello-world-content-types#_an_echo_interceptor[Hello World, With
Content Types] for an explanation of the echo interceptor.)

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::todo-api/src/main.clj[tags=routes]
----

We will be able to poke each of the routes and check that the
parameters all work. This is a nice way to break your work up into
incremental steps. It goes together nicely with the interactive
development support we introduced in the
link:./hello-world-query-parameters#_interactive_development[Hello World, With Parameters]
guide.

Get ready for a _ton_ of output:

== Poking the Routes

Let's try out the routes that we defined in the `main`
namespace. We'll do that using
link:../api/io.pedestal.test.html#var-response-for[`io.pedestal.test/response-for`]. This
function exercises our server without going through any actual HTTP
requests. We give it a "service function" (which is one of the values
in the server map), an HTTP verb, and a URL.

----

The response is pretty large because we are using the `echo`
interceptor, so the whole request is nested inside the response. If we
omit the response body, it isn't quite so hard to read.

----
user=> (dissoc (test/response-for (:io.pedestal.http/service-fn @main/server) :get "/todo") :body)
[main] INFO io.pedestal.http - {:msg "GET /todo", :line 80}

user=>
----

Now we can see the status code (200, OK) and the headers. Not
too bad. What happens if we ask for a route that doesn't exist? Or a
verb that isn't supported on a real route?

----
user=> (dissoc (test/response-for (:io.pedestal.http/service-fn @main/server) :get "/no-such-route") :body)
[main] INFO io.pedestal.http - {:msg "GET /no-such-route", :line 80}

[main] INFO io.pedestal.http - {:msg "DELETE /todo", :line 80}
{:status 404, :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}}
user=>
----

This 404 response comes from Pedestal itself. That is the default
response when the router cannot find a route that matches the URL
pattern _and_ passes constraints. (For much more about routers, see
link:../reference/index#_routing_and_linking[the Routing and Linking] references.)

=== Path Parameters

Some of our routes have parameters in them. Those look like keywords
embedded in the URL patterns. That tells Pedestal to match any value
in that position (except a slash!) and bind it to that parameter in
the link:../reference/request-map[request map]. We should be able to
see those parameters in the requests that `echo` will send back
to us. This is one of the ways we can make sure that routes do what we
think they are going to do, before we write the real logic.

----

The interesting part here is kind of buried inside the request map
(which is a string inside the response body). We can pull it out with
a bit of Clojure code, but I'll just highlight it here. (If you're
interested in an exercise, try using `clojure.edn` to extract the
request.)

Inside the request, there is a map `:path-params` which looks like
this:

[source,clojure]
----
:path-params {:list-id "abcdef", :item-id "12345"}}
----

Pedestal extracted these parameters from the URL and bound them to
the request for us. Note that the values are always strings, because
URLs are strings. If we want to treat "12345" as a number, that's up
to us. But our application had better not break if some sly user sends
us up a request with something other than numbers there.

== Create List

The first request to handle is creating lists. This is a POST to the
"/todo" URL. In the interest of simplicity, the only part of a request
body we need is a name field. Also in the interest of simplicity, we
are not going to deal with content negotiation yet.

What do we need to do in order to create a list?

1. Make a new data structure for the list.
1. Add it to our repository.

We could do this all in one handler function. But we should take
advantage of the interceptor construct to separate concerns. A very
typical request lifecycle in Pedestal looks like this:

1. `A` attaches a database connection to the request.
1. `B` looks up an item of interest and attaches it to
the request.
1. `C` makes decisions and attaches the result of
those decisions to the request.
1. `D` executes a transaction with those decisions.

This way, `A` and `D` are quite generic. They can even be the `enter`
and `leave` functions of the same interceptor. `B` is lightly
parameterized. Only `C` is unique to each request type.

(By the way, when using Datomic, `A` also grabs the current database
value and attaches it to the request as well.)

For this guide, we are going to cheat and create an in-memory
repository:

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::todo-api/src/main.clj[tag=repository]
----

And the interceptor to snapshot the database and handle transactions:

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::todo-api/src/main.clj[tag=db_interceptor]
----
<1> `@database` gets the current value of the atom. We attach it to
the request inside the context.
<2> The `:tx-data` key on the context may be set by other
interceptors.
<3> The `do` block is a sure sign of a side effect. The `swap!` here is our stand-in for a real database transaction.
<4> We attach the updated database value in case any other
interceptors need to use it.
<5> If there wasn't any tx-data, we just return the context without
changes. If you forget this and return nil, every request will respond
with 404.

Now we need a handler to receive the request, extract a name, and
create the actual list.

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::todo-api/src/main.clj[tag=list_create]

include::todo-api/src/main.clj[tag=routes_with_list_create]
----
<1> If there was a query parameter, use it. Otherwise use a placeholder.
<2> Generate a unique ID. In a real service, the DB itself would do
this for us.
<3> Don't modify the DB here. Attach data to the context that the
db-interceptor will use.
<4> We modify the route definition to use both new interceptors, in
order.

There are a couple of things to notice about this updated route
definition. First, instead of using `echo` here, we have a vector with
our `db-interceptor` and `list-create` interceptors. Recall from
link:hello-world-content-types#_interceptors[the introduction to
interceptors] that interceptors have two functions. The `:enter`
functions get called from left to right, then the `:leave` functions
get called from right to left. That means calls to the
`db-interceptor` bracket the call to the `list-create` interceptor.

The second thing about the new route is that we removed the
`:route-name :list-create` clause. Pedestal requires that every route
must have a unique name. When we used the `echo` interceptor
everywhere, there was no way for Pedestal to create unique, meaningful
names for the routes so we had to help it out. Now, `list-create` has
it's own name so we can let Pedestal do it's default behavior: use the
name of the last interceptor in the vector.

(Incidentally, when you use a function in a route, Pedestal also can't
pick a good name for you. A function value doesn't carry any reference
back to it's original definition. There are quoting forms you can read
about in link:../reference/index#_routing_and_linking[the routing and
linking] reference that offer some tricks for that.)

Let's give it a try. Here's a new helper function to make it easier to
try requests out interactively:

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::todo-api/src/main.clj[tag=test_request]
----

With this new helper we can try out a lot of requests from the REPL.
Don't forget to reload the main namespace in the REPL with `(require
:reload 'main)` and restart the server with `(main/restart)` before
you do.

----
user> (main/test-request :post "/todo?name=A-List")
{:status 404, :body "Not Found", :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}}
----

Uh oh. What happened here? We just tried this route a minute ago. Was
it the query parameter?

----
user> (main/test-request :post "/todo")
{:status 404, :body "Not Found", :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}}
----

Nope.

If you check the contents of your in-memory database by running
`@main/database` in the REPL, you'll see the new item in there. So why
did Pedestal complain about a 404?

The problem is that neither the `list-create` or `db-interceptor`
interceptor attached any kind of response to the context. Pedestal
looked at the context after running all the interceptors, saw that
there was no response, and sent the 404 as a fallback. We need to
attach a response somewhere.

=== Url-for

The usual thing in REST APIs is to return a 201 status code, with a
"Location" header that identifies where the new resource
lives. Pedestal provides a function to generate a URL by route name
and even interpolate parameters into it. So our `list-create`
interceptor can point the client over to a route that will render the
new list.

Of course, it would be nice if the response body also included the
current state of the brand new list. That saves the client a round
trip and saves the service a request. For now, we can do this all in
one interceptor.

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::todo-api/src/main.clj[tags=list_create_with_response]
----
<1> Generate URL for route `:list-view` and the new ID we just generated.

And the results:

----
user> (main/test-request :post "/todo?name=A")
{:status 201, :body "{:name \"A\", :items []}", :headers {"Strict-Transport-Security" "max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains", "X-Frame-Options" "DENY", "X-Content-Type-Options" "nosniff", "X-XSS-Protection" "1; mode=block", "Location" "/todo/l30488", "Content-Type" "application/edn"}}
----

One quick note about the response body: in general, adding something
to the database might cause it to change. Sometimes there are triggers
or stored procedures that change it. Other times it's just an ID being
assigned. Usually, instead of attaching the new entity here, I would
attach its ID to the context and use _another_ interceptor later in
the chain to look up the entity after `db-interceptor` executes the
transaction.

This becomes especially important when you are updating existing
entities that could have concurrent changes from many sources.

== View List

Now that we've done one route, this will go a bit faster. The
connection from route to interceptor to entity should be a bit more
evident at this point.

To view a list, we need to look it up from the "database". If it
doesn't exist, we need to return a 404 (which can be done by omitting
a response body). If it does exist, we send it in the response.

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::todo-api/src/main.clj[tags=list_view]
----
<1> "Query" our fake database.
<2> If there was a path parameter, we will use it. Otherwise, 404.
<3> If the path parameter names an actual list, we will
use it. Otherwise, 404.
<4> Everything is OK, so return the list.

== Add Item to List

Even faster this time! We need to check that the list exists, modify
it, and return the new item.

I hope that some alarm bells are going off for you now. I just
described a sequence of actions. That means time could pass while
executing those actions. What happens if the list is there when we
check it but gets deleted before we try to add the new item?

This is the kind of thing that is really important to do
_atomically_. We can take advantage of that Clojure atom to execute a
function atomically. That's what the `swap!` call does for us.

But since that function might not succeed, it means we don't know
enough to create the response inside the `list-item-create`
interceptor. We need to defer response creation until after the
`db-interceptor` runs its `leave` function. Basically, we need
something to look up an item by it's list ID and item ID, then render
the result.

That's exactly what we would do for the `:list-item-view` route! We
can get some reuse here. If `list-item-create` can add the item to the
DB, then the item will exist. Otherwise it will be a 404. We just need
to do something a little funky-looking with the `list-item-view`
interceptor. We need to put it's behavior in the `leave` function
instead of the `enter` function.

Here's the pair of new interceptors, plus the updated route table.

[source,clojure]
.src/main.clj
----
include::todo-api/src/main.clj[tags=list_item_create]
----
<1> New generic interceptor that makes an 200 OK response with EDN
body out of any Clojure data structure.
<2> New interceptor that looks up list items but doesn't attach a
response.
<3> Instead, list-item-view attaches the result to the context where
`entity-render` expects to find it.
<4> This interceptor creates an item and sets up tx-data to be
executed.
<5> This is where `list-item-create` passes a parameter to
`list-item-view`.

To understand the interceptors for the `:list-item-create` route, we
need to think about `enter` functions from left to right and `leave`
functions from right to left.

|===
| Phase | Interceptor | Action

| Enter | `entity-render    ` | None.
| Enter | `list-item-view   ` | None.
| Enter | `db-interceptor   ` | Attach the DB value to the context.
| Enter | `list-item-create ` | Attach tx-data to the context and a
  path-param to identify the item.
| Leave | `list-item-create ` | None.
| Leave | `db-interceptor   ` | Execute the tx-data, attach updated DB value to context.
| Leave | `list-item-view   ` | Find the (new) item by path-params,
  attach it to the context as :result.
| Leave | `entity-render    ` | Find :result on the context, make an OK response.

|===

Splitting the work into these pipelined stages allows us to make very
small, very targeted functions that collaborate via the context.

(By the way, that repetetively nesting structure in list-item-view is
a perfect candidate for a Clojure macro. I'll leave that as an
exercise for you, Dear Reader.)

The rest of the routes follow these same basic patterns. Take a few
minutes to see if you can create the interceptors for the next few.

== The Whole Shebang

Here is the final version of the code. Everything is cleaned, folded,
and sorted nicely.

== The Path So Far

In this guide, we have built a new API with an in-memory
database. You're ready to go get funding and launch!

We covered some more advanced concepts with interceptors this time:

* Passing results from one interceptor to another
* Reusing interceptors in different routes
* Separating query from transaction with `enter` and `leave` functions
* Testing our routes interactively at a REPL.
