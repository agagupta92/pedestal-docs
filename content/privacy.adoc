=== CHILDREN’S PRIVACY ===

We do not direct our Website or services to children (usually considered to be under the age of 13, depending on the country where you reside).

=== GAINING ACCESS TO, UPDATING DELETING YOUR INFORMATION OR WITHDRAWING CONSENT ===

If at any time you want to request, update, correct or remove Personal Information, you are welcome to submit a request to mailto:support@cognitect.com[support@cognitect.com].  We may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.  If you are aware of changes or inaccuracies in your Personal Information, you should inform us of such changes so that our records may be updated or corrected.

We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).

Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so, except where it would require a disproportionate effort.  We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction.  Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.

Where consent is required for our use of your Personal Information as described herein, you have the right to withdraw or decline your consent and cease your use of the Website.  If you decide to withdraw your consent, such withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before such withdrawal.
