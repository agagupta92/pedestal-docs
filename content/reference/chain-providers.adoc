Pedestal uses a chain of link:interceptors[interceptors] to process incoming HTTP requests and provide outgoing HTTP responses.
However, the underlying code - the interceptors and the interceptor chain that executes them - is more general.

Interceptor chains can be used for a variety of operations, such as:

- Processing messages from a queue, such as Kafka or JMS
- Performing a series of transformations on documents as part of a publishing service
- Processing outgoing requests and incoming responses from a back-end service

A _chain provider_ is responsible for accepting an incoming stimuli (such as an incoming HTTP request)
and setting up a link:context-map [context map] and initial interceptors to process that stimuli.
The service map is processed via the
link:../api/io.pedestal.interceptor.chain.html#var-execute[`execute`] function.

Part of a chain provider's responsibility is to identify when a request has been processed; for
HTTP requests, this is when a handler or some other interceptor attaches a `:response` map to the context map.

Pedestal itself only provides a chain provider implementation for incoming HTTP request processing,
in the form of the link:servlet-interceptor[servlet interceptor].
