The building blocks of Pedestal are not limited to web
applications. The link:interceptors[interceptor] concept is very
general and can be used in message-processing or dataflow applications
just as well as request/reply web services.

A _chain provider_ invokes a queue of interceptors in response to some
stimulus. The job of a chain provider is to accept incoming stimuli
(requests, messages, events, commands, etc.) set up the
link:context-map[context map] and execute a queue of interceptors via
link:../api/io.pedestal.interceptor.chain.html#var-execute[`execute`].

For HTTP, the link:servlet-interceptor[servlet interceptor] is the
chain provider.
