The major parts of Pedestal are isolated via Clojure protocols. The
protocols are for internal structure and external extension. This
reference identifies the most important protocols in Pedestal's
structure and how you might use them in an application.

== Interceptor Protocols

=== link:../api/io.pedestal.interceptor.html#var-IntoInterceptor[`IntoInterceptor`]

`IntoInterceptor` allows pretty much anything to become an interceptor
when needed.

Routers use this when building routes: anything that satisfies
`IntoInterceptor` is legal to use in the interceptor vector of a
route.

[IMPORTANT]
.*Dynamically added interceptors*

--
At runtime, new interceptors may be added to the
link:interceptors#_manipulating_the_interceptor_queue[queue] dynamically;
(this is what routing itself does); to ensure best runtime performance, `IntoInterceptor` is not
automatically used; it is assumed any added interceptors are, in fact,
the records that `IntoInterceptor` returns.
--

Pedestal extends `IntoInterceptor` onto a variety of Clojure and Java
types. See the link:interceptors#_intointerceptor[interceptors
reference] for details of their behaviors.

== Routing Protocols

These protocols break up the lifecycle of routes and allow both
extension points and alternative strategies in several places.

Over time, Pedestal has evolved several data structures for representing routing;
at the core, they map an HTTP method and URI path to a set of interceptors and a handler.
Each of these data structures is a kind of _routing specification_.

In parallel to the data structures, Pedestal has several algorithms for using the routing specification to dispatch
an incoming request; some algorithms may be most efficient for small services with very few routes, others
are better for large services with more and more complex routes.

The protocols described here are what allows the individual pieces to cooperate; this also means
that it is possible to define an application-specific routing specification format and use it with a Pedestal-supplied
algorithm, or using a built-in routing specification and combine it with an application-specific algorithm.

=== link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.router.html#var-Router[`Router`]

The combination of routing specification with a routing algorithm results in an instance of the `Router` interface.

The `Router` protocol defines just one function: `find-route`. `find-route` is passed the `Router`
itself and a link:request-map[request map], and must return the route map for the route that it matched.
The route map not only identifies the interceptors and handler to add to the interceptor queue, but further
captures path variables that may be part of the matched URL (further details TBD).

An instance of `Router` is returned by the router constructor
identified in the application's link:service-map[service map] by the key `:io.pedestal.http/router`.

|===
| ::http/router Value  | Constructor
| :linear-search | link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.linear-search.html#var-router[`linear-search/router`]
| :prefix-tree   | link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.prefix-tree.html#var-router[`prefix-tree/router`]
| :map-tree      | link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.map-tree.html#var-map-tree[`map-tree/router`]
| application-supplied function | The function itself, called with sequence of routes as returned by from the `RouterSpecification` instance
|===

Whether built-in, or supplied by the application, the constructor is just a function that is passed an expanded route specification,
and returns an instance of `Router`.

=== link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-RouterSpecification[`RouterSpecification`]

The `RouterSpecification` protocol is used to create a routing interceptor from some
definition of routes, and a single `Router`. This is the final step in the
process of turning a routing specification into a routing interceptor.

Whatever is returned from the
link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-router-spec[`router-spec`]
function of the protocol must be an interceptor. The returned interceptor will include an `:enter` callback that
must accept a link:context-map[context map] and enqueue
link:interceptors[interceptors] based on whatever criteria it chooses.

=== link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-ExpandableRoutes[`ExpandableRoutes`]

`ExpandableRoutes` can convert all kinds of data structures representing a routing specification into a single
canonical format that can be used to construct a `Router`. This occurs inside the
link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-expand-routes[`expand-routes`]
function.

Pedestal provides implementations of `ExpandableRoutes` for several types:

|===
| Type | Behavior
| `clojure.lang.APersistentVector` | Interpret the vector as link:terse-syntax[terse routing syntax].
| `clojure.lang.APersistentMap`    | Interpret the map as link:verbose-syntax[verbose routing syntax].
| `clojure.lang.APersistentSet`    | Interpret the set as link:table-syntax[table routing syntax].
|===

Since the call to `expand-routes` comes from application code, it
would be rare for an application to need to extend `ExpandableRoutes`.

The result of `expand-routes` is a link:routing-quick-reference#_verbose_syntax[seq of maps] that will
be passed to the `Router`.

== Servlet Protocols

These protocols only apply when using the link:servlet-interceptor[`servlet interceptor`].

=== link:../api/io.pedestal.http.impl.servlet-interceptor.html#var-WritableBody[`WritableBody`]

This protocol applies to anything that can be in the `:body` key of a
link:response-map[response map]. The two functions in the protocol
tell Pedestal what content type the body implies, and how to serialize
the body to an output stream.

Pedestal extends this protocol to several Java and Clojure types to produce the behavior detailed in link:response-bodies[Response Bodies].

Applications should not assume any output stream type more specific
than `java.io.OutputStream`.

=== link:../api/io.pedestal.http.impl.servlet-interceptor.html#var-WritableBodyAsync[`WritableBodyAsync`]

This protocol is a more specific version of `WritableBody`. If the
value in the `:body` key of a link:response-map[response map]
satisfies `WritableBodyAsync`, then Pedestal treats it as a streaming
result. See link:streaming[Streaming] for full details.

It would be rare for an application to extend this protocol. Most of
the time, an application would be better off providing an NIO channel
or a core.async channel in the response body.
