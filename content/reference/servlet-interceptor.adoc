As the name implies, the servlet interceptor is both a servlet and an
interceptor. It is created when an application calls
`io.pedestal.http/create-server` or `io.pedestal.http/create-servlet`.

When created, the servlet interceptor creates the global interceptor queue,
which includes a couple of interceptors private to the servlet interceptor and then
additional interceptors provided by the application; a key interceptor will
perform routing, which will add route-matched interceptors to the queue.

The servlet interceptor is a link:chain-providers[chain provider] that
invokes interceptors when an HTTP request arrives.

The servlet interceptor performs the following tasks:

   1. It sets up the link:context-map[context map] and the
   link:request-map[request map].
   2. Executes the interceptor queue.
   3. Catches any exceptions that aren't handled by
   link:error-handling[error handling] within the interceptors.
   4. Writes the final link:response-map[response map] to the servlet
   response.

There are a couple of special cases to note.

## Manipulating the Queue and Stack

Interceptors may rewrite the interceptor queue by calling functions
link:../api/io.pedestal.interceptor.chain.html#var-enqueue[`enqueue`]
and
link:../api/io.pedestal.interceptor.chain.html#var-terminate[`terminate`].

[WARNING]
--
Interceptors may also change the interceptor queue by directly changing the values
of the `:io.pedestal.interceptor.chain/stack` and
`:io.pedestal.interceptor.chain/queue` in the link:context-map[context map].
This should be avoided when possible, as manipulating the stack and queue improperly
may have unintended consequences.
--

The queue contains the interceptors to be executed next. The first
item in the queue will be the next interceptor considered.
When an interceptor's `:enter` function is executed, it is removed from the queue and added to the stack.

The stack contains the previously executed interceptors that need their `:leave` functions
called. The top of the stack will be considered first.

## Early Termination

Before invoking the `:enter` functions, the servlet interceptor sets
up a _terminator_ predicate on the context.
This predicate is passed the context map and returns a truthy value
if execution should transition from `:enter` to `:leave`.

The default predicate checks to see if the `:response` context key is present and, if so, is
a valid Ring response map; that is, does it have a `:status` key of type integer, and a `:headers` key
containing a map?

The end result is that in some cases, interceptors (including handlers) will not get executed for
a particular request.  For example, an application that has a concept of authentication
may include an interceptor that checks for valid credentials in the request, and adds a `:response` map
to the context when the credentials are missing or invalid. That will cause the response to immediately
be sent to the client, bypassing any later interceptors.

In addition, it is possible to have more than one termination predicate; if any predicate returns
a truthy value, then the `:enter` execution will terminate.
New predicates can be appended using
link:../api/io.pedestal.interceptor.chain.html#var-terminate-when[terminate-when].

## Partial Responses

In very rare cases, different interceptors may provide different parts of response.
Ultimately, the response must be a valid Ring response, but different interceptors may
provide different parts of the response (the `:body` or certain values in the `:headers` map).

If your application requires this, be very careful about early termination.

   1. Put the initial value into the response map in the last `:enter`
   function, then use the `:leave` functions to refine that value.
   2. Put the initial value into the context under a different key and
   refine that value in either `:enter` or `:leave` functions. When
   the response is complete, transfer the response map to the `:response` key.
