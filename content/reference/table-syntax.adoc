== Quick Reference

=== Route Vector Format

1. Path string
2. Verb. One of :any, :get, :put, :post, :delete, :patch, :options, :head
3. Handler or vector of interceptors
4. (Optional) Route name clause
5. (Optional) Constraint clause

== Detailed Reference

=== Path string

The path string must:

- Start with a slash ("/")
- Consist of zero or more path segments separated by slashes.

Each path segment is one of:

1. A string literal
2. A colon (":") followed by a legal Clojure identifier name. This is a path parameter.
3. An asterisk ("*") followed by a legal Clojure identifier name. This is a wildcard path.

When routing a request, a path parameter will match any characters
other than a slash. The matched string will be bound to the request by
the path parameter name from the route.

For example, using the route `/users/:id/orders/:order-id`, the following request URLs would be treated as:

[cols="2,1,5"]
|===
| URL | Match? | Path params

| /users/abcdef/orders
| No
|

| /users/abcdef/orders/12345
| Yes
| `{:id "abcdef" :order-id "12345"}`

| /users/123545/orders/From%20Strings
| Yes
| `{:id "123545" :order-id "From Strings"}`
|===

All path parameter values are strings.

NOTE: If you wish to use a wild card route as a fallback route then route order
matters. To maintain order during route evaluation, use the link:linear-search-router[Linear Search] router
and expand your routes explicitly by passing them to the link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.definition.table.html#var-table-routes[`table-routes`]
function using a vector as the top-level collection instead of a set. Keep in
mind that wildcard fallback routes are not recommended since they tend to
increase the complexity of handler logic.




=== HTTP Verb

By default, The verb must be one of the keywords in `#{:any, :get, :put, :post,
:delete, :patch, :options, :head}`. However, you can override the verbs by
including an options map with the keyword `:verb` in your route definition. The
value of `:verb` is the `set` of verb keywords you wish to support. It is
through this facility that you can specify custom verbs.

==== Syntax for specifying verbs

[source,clojure]
----
(def routes #{{:verbs #{:get :stats :version}}
              ["/" :get (conj common-interceptors `home-page)]
              ["/" :stats (conj common-interceptors `stats)]
              ["/" :version (conj common-interceptors `version)]})
----

NOTE: `:any` is a wildcard verb. During request routing, `:any` will match
all requests.

=== Handler or Interceptors

The "handler position" be anything that satisfies the link:../api/pedestal.interceptor/io.pedestal.interceptor.html#var-IntoInterceptor[`IntoInterceptor`] protocol. This includes:

- Function value
- Symbol
- Var
- Map
- List

=== Route Name Clause

A route name clause is the keyword `:route-name` followed by a keyword. Route names must be unique.

=== Constraint Clause

A constraint clause is the keyword `:constraints` followed by a map.
