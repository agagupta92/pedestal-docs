As its name implies, the terse syntax provides a compact approach for
describing routes. When the argument to
link:../api/pedestal.route/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-expand-routes[`expand-routes`]
is a *vector*, it will be expanded using the terse syntax.

Unlike the Table or Verbose syntax, it allows for the nesting
of route definitions where each nested route vector adds a path segment.

Unlike the Table syntax, any verb can be specified without verb whitelisting.

A route table is a vector of nested vectors. Top-level
vector(s) are termed _application_ vectors. Nested vectors are termed _route_
vectors.

== Quick Reference

=== Application Vector Format

1. (Optional) A keyword identifying the application by name
2. (Optional) A URL scheme
3. (Optional) A host name
4. (Optional) A port
5. One or more nested route vectors.

=== Route Vector Format

1. A path segment (must begin with a slash)
2. A verb map
3. (Optional) An interceptor vector with `^:interceptors` metadata
footnoteref:[1,can also be specified befure the verb map.]
footnoteref:[2,Apply to the current route and any child routes.]
4. (Optional) A constraints map with `^:constraints` metadata footnoteref:[1] footnoteref:[2]
5. Zero or more child route vectors

(def routes

    ["/order" {:get  `list-orders
               :post [:post-without-id `create-order]}

      ^:interceptors [load-order-from-db]
      ^:constraints  {:id #"[0-9]+"}
      {:get `view-order

       :post [:post-by-id `create-order]}]]]])

== Detailed Reference

=== Path string

The path string must:

- Start with a slash ("/")
- Consist of zero or more path segments separated by slashes.

Each path segment is one of:

1. A string literal
2. A colon (":") followed by a legal Clojure identifier name. This is a path parameter.
3. An asterisk ("*") followed by a legal Clojure identifier name. This is a wildcard path.

When routing a request, a path parameter will match any characters
other than a slash. The matched string will be bound to the request by
the path parameter name from the route.

For example, using the route `/users/:id/orders/:order-id`, the following request URLs would be treated as:

[cols="2,1,5"]
|===
| URL | Match? | Path params

| /users/abcdef/orders
| No
|

| /users/abcdef/orders/12345
| Yes
| `{:id "abcdef" :order-id "12345"}`

| /users/123545/orders/From%20Strings
| Yes
| `{:id "123545" :order-id "From Strings"}`
|===

All path parameter values are strings.

NOTE: If you wish to use a wild card route as a fallback route then use the link:linear-search-router[Linear Search] router.
Keep in mind that wildcard fallback routes are not recommended since they tend to increase the complexity of handler logic.

=== Verb map

The verb map contains verb to handler mappings. Each verb in the verb map
defines a route. If a handler is referenced by multiple routes, a route name
must be specified. The route name is a keyword which occurs in the first
position of an interceptor vector in the verb map.

Unlike the Table Route syntax, custom verbs do not need to be white listed.
However, `:any` is a wildcard verb. During request routing, `:any` will match
all requests.

=== Handler or Interceptors

The "handler position" be anything that satisfies the link:../api/pedestal.interceptor/io.pedestal.interceptor.html#var-IntoInterceptor[`IntoInterceptor`] protocol. This includes:

- Function value
- Symbol
- Var
- Map
- List
