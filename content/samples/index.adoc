== Basic Features

* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/hello-world[Hello World] - A bare-minimum Pedestal service that greets visitors.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/ring-middleware[Ring Middleware] - Demonstrates session storage using the cookie store using `ring.middleware.session.cookie`.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/server-with-links[Route Hyperlinks] - Demonstrates generating a hyperlink from your application's routing table.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/template-server[HTML Template Rendering] - Demonstrates rendering HTML page templates with various engines (e.g. Hiccup, Enlive, Mustache, String Template and Comb).

== HTTP Features

* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/http2[HTTP/2] - Demonstrates using Jetty's HTTP/2 capabilties.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/cors[CORS] - Demonstrates http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing] usage.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/jetty-web-sockets[Web Sockets] - Demonstrates WebSockets usage with Pedestal and Jetty.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/server-sent-events[Server Sent Events (SSE)] - Demonstrates setup, usage and cleanup of an SSE
event stream using multiple event source threads.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/servlet-filters-gzip[Servlet Filters (gzip)] - Demonstrates use of Servlet Filters and Jetty Handlers within Pedestal services.

== Security

* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/buddy-auth[Authn/z] - Demonstrates authentication and authorization using the https://funcool.github.io/buddy-auth/latest/[buddy-auth] library.
with a Basic Authentication backend. Good example of porting middleware functions (e.g. `wrap-authentication` and
`wrap-authorization`) to interceptors.
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/http2-conscrypt[Google Conscrypt] - Demonstrates use of Google's https://github.com/google/conscrypt[Conscrypt Security Provider] for SSL. Uses HTTP/2.

== Cloud Integration

* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/aws-codestar-lambda[AWS Lambda] - Demonstrates running a Pedestal Service on AWS Lambda via API Gateway.
Designed to be a https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/[CodeStar] project and ships with CodePipeline and CloudFormation support.

== Logging, Tracing, and Metrics

* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/helloworld-metrics[Metrics] - Demonstrates Pedestal's metrics capabilities (available since 0.5.0).
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/tracing[Distributed Tracing (Jaeger)] - Demonstrates https://opentracing.io/[OpenTracing] API with https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger[Jaeger]
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/tracing-interceptor[Tracing Interceptor] - Demonstrates distributed tracing with Jaeger using Pedestal's Trace Interceptor.

* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/nio[NIO] - Demonstrates using a ByteBuffer as a response body. For large response
amidst a high number of concurrent connections, using NIO (via a ByteBuffer or ReadableByteChannel) can increase your app's performance.

== Alternate Servers

* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/immutant[Immutant] - The `hello-world` example, adapted to use http://immutant.org[Immutant].
* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/chain-providers[Chain Providers] - Demonstrates using Pedestal with a custom backend server.
Interceptor Chain Providers allow Pedestal to be used with any HTTP Server supported by the JVM.

== Packaging and Deployment

* https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples/war-example[WAR File] - Demonstrates tooling and options for building a deployable WAR file.
